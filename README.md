## Topic: Proof of Concept (POC) for a Vaccine to Prevent Cavities
The reason for selecting this topic is that we have an ongoing study, and we need to determine the effects that a potential vaccine candidate has in a sample population of 10 subjects. In this study, we will be monitoring and evaluating cavities after the vaccine is administered and the immune response the vaccine generates against the antigens (target) we are using in our vaccine.
The data generated from this in vivo preclinical POC testing will be useful in guiding the design of both preclinical studies as well as the early-phase clinical trials, while contributing to defining reasonable risk for the investigational product in the intended patient population.


## Purpose:
Developing a vaccine is a complex long process. Before a vaccine is available to the public, it must go through several stages of testing. The first stage is the proof of concept (POC). During this stage, studies can be performed in rodents such as mice, rats, rabbits, etc. The goal of a POC is to determine if the vaccine induces a positive immune response against the virus or bacteria we are targeting, and the immune response protects the individual either from getting the decease or lessening the symptoms. 

## Description of the source of data:
Subjects will be given three vaccinations at three different time points. Blood samples will be collected after each time point to measure the antibody response and measurements of each tooth will be performed to measure pocket depth. Our subjects have 32 teeth/each, each tooth will have four measurements at four different time points.

### WHAT DO THE MEASUREMENTS MEAN?
Typically smaller and tighter measurements mean healthier gums. When evaluating your gum health, we also review your x-rays as well as visual signs of healthy gums. 

0-3mm without bleeding means you are in great shape. 
1-3mm with bleeding is an early sign of gingivitis. Better at-home care will probably get you back on track!

3-5mm without bleeding means gum disease is possible. Weâ€™ll help you with some instructions for home and possibly schedule another visit a little sooner.
3-5mm with bleeding could be the beginning of gum disease. This can require additional treatment and more frequent visits.

5-7mm with bleeding means tissue damage and probably bone loss. More hygiene visits and special treatment will probably be necessary in addition to better at-home care.
7mm and above with bleeding is generally the advanced stage of periodontal disease. Surgery to repair bone loss and frequent periodontal maintenance will be required.
## Question we hope to answer with the data:
Does the vaccine have a positive impact in preventing, reducing, or slowing down cavity?
