## Topic: Proof of Concept (POC) for a Vaccine
The reason we selected this topic is that we have an ongoing study to determine the immunogenecity that a potential vaccine candidate has in sample population of 32 subjects. The data generated from this in vivo preclinical POC testing will be useful in guiding the design of both preclinical studies as well as the early-phase clinical trials, while contributing to defining reasonable risk for the investigational product in the intended patient population.

## Purpose:

Developing a vaccine is a complex long process. Before a vaccine is available to the public, it must go through several stages of testing. The first stage is the proof of concept (POC). During this stage, studies can be performed in rodents such as mice, rats, rabbits, etc. During this stage, the ultimate goal is to determine if the vaccine induces a positive immune response againts the virus or bacteria we are targeting.
