## Topic: Proof of Concept (POC) for a Vaccine to Prevent Cavities
The reason for selecting this topic is that we have an ongoing study to determine the immunogenecity that a potential vaccine candidate  has in a sample population of X subjects. In this study, we will be evaluating the progression of cavities after the vaccine is administer and the immune response the vaccine generates againts the antigents (target) we are using in our vaccine.
The data generated from this in vivo preclinical POC testing will be useful in guiding the design of both preclinical studies as well as the early-phase clinical trials, while contributing to defining reasonable risk for the investigational product in the intended patient population.

## Purpose:

Developing a vaccine is a complex long process. Before a vaccine is available to the public, it must go through several stages of testing. The first stage is the proof of concept (POC). During this stage, studies can be performed in rodents such as mice, rats, rabbits, etc. During this stage, the ultimate goal is to determine if the vaccine induces a positive immune response againts the virus or bacteria we are targeting. 

## Description of the source of data:
Subjects will be giving three vaccinations at three diffrent points. Blood samples will be collected after each time point to measure the antibody response and other measurements will be perfomed as well.
