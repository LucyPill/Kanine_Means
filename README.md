## Topic: Proof of Concept (POC) for a Vaccine to Prevent Cavities
The reason for selecting this topic is that we have an ongoing study, and we need to determine the effects that a potential vaccine candidate has in a sample population of 10 subjects. In this study, we will be monitoring and evaluating cavities after the vaccine is administer and the immune response the vaccine generates against the antigens (target) we are using in our vaccine.
The data generated from this in vivo preclinical POC testing will be useful in guiding the design of both preclinical studies as well as the early-phase clinical trials, while contributing to defining reasonable risk for the investigational product in the intended patient population.


## Purpose:
Developing a vaccine is a complex long process. Before a vaccine is available to the public, it must go through several stages of testing. The first stage is the proof of concept (POC). During this stage, studies can be performed in rodents such as mice, rats, rabbits, etc. The goal of a POC is to determine if the vaccine induces a positive immune response against the virus or bacteria we are targeting, and the immune response protects the individual either from getting the decease or lessening the symptoms. 

## Description of the source of data:
Subjects will be giving three vaccinations at three different time points. Blood samples will be collected after each time point to measure the antibody response and measurements of each tooth will be performed. Our subjects have 32 teeth/each, each tooth will have four measurements at four different time points.

## Question we hope to answer with the data:
Does the vaccine have a positive impact in preventing, reducing, or slowing down cavity?
